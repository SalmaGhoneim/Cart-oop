# Cart-oop
Object Oriented JavaScript - a mini cart.

USING some ES6 features may cause problems in running the classes.
we use gulp & babel to generate es5 equivalent files, then run those files.

TO run the tests
after cloning the repo open a cmd,
go to repo folder. 
then type npm test.
this will trigger gulp && run the tests.
